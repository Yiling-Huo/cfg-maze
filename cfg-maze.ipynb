    "## What is the Maze task?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Maze Task is an experimental task used by many psycholinguists. In this task, the participant follows a sentence through a \"maze\". They will see two words at a time, and one of the words will be the correct word that continues the sentence. The participant will only reach the end of the sentence by selecting the correct word at each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for the sentence 'The rain fell silently', the participant may see something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Example maze task presentation from https://www.u.arizona.edu/~kforster/MAZE/how_it_works.htm](assets/example-maze-task.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "This task forces the reader into an incremental mode of processing in which each word must be fully integrated with the preceding context before the next word can be considered. Psycholinguists usually measure the reaction time needed to make the correct selection, which is associated with the difficulty of integrating the word with the previous words (the context). \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Maze task as a game\n",
    "\n",
    "Psycholinguists use the maze task to study human sentence processing, but as you can see, for participants in the maze task, there is a goal (to get to the correct sentence) and there is a challenge (to avoid the wrong choice), so it can be something like a game. \n",
    "\n",
    "## A CFG Maze game\n",
    "\n",
    "We just learned how to use CFG to generate sentences in Python. We can use that to generate trials in the Maze task. Because the sentences we generate from CFG don't have the 'points of processing difficulty' that psycholinguists study, so we can simply make it a small game (instead of a proper experiment that answers a research question). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Modify generate() to return both the sentence and the alternative option at each position\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember in a maze task, at each word, the participant sees two options, one is correct, the other is not. We can modify generate() to give us both the sentence (the correct options) and the alternatives (the incorrect options). \n",
    "\n",
    "First let's consider what should be the alternative (incorrect) option? It has to be incorrect, so let's just say in the context of CFG, it cannot be a grammatical continuation of the last word. This means that the correct option needs to block all words that belong to the same node as the correct option, or any nodes that occupy the same syntactic position as the correct option's node. This is what's in `block_list`. "
